Files used in phaseme/simwrap toolkit
This is supposed to contain the files used in the phaseme/simwrap toolkit for safe storage/editing/track changes.
I am using libraries that I haven't uploaded here (I guess they'd be too big but can revisit) so the files shouldn't really compile
like that

(Using boost and Eigen)
